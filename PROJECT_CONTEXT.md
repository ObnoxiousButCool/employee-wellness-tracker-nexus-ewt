# Project Context — Employee Wellness Tracker Nexus (EWT)

## 1. Overview
Employee Wellness Tracker Nexus (EWT) is a wellness-tracking system for organizations, with
role-based access for Admins, Managers, and Employees. The backend is a Node.js/Express API
backed by PostgreSQL via Prisma; the frontend is a Next.js (App Router) application. As of
story S1, the system provides credential-based authentication (login/logout) issuing an
httpOnly JWT session cookie, plus role-guard middleware that other stories will use to protect
future API routes. The frontend calls the backend through its own Next.js Route Handler proxies
(`app/api/auth/*`) rather than directly from the browser, and gates the three role-specific
landing pages (`/admin/dashboard`, `/manager/dashboard`, `/employee/home`) with a `<RoleGuard>`
server component.

## 3. API Contract (cumulative)

### POST /api/auth/login — introduced in S1 (Backend)
- **Request body:** `{ "email": string, "password": string }`
- **Success response (200):** sets an httpOnly, Secure (in production), SameSite=Strict cookie
  named `ewt_token` containing a signed JWT (HS256, 8h expiry, claims: `userId`, `role`,
  `departmentId`). Response body: `{ "userId": 1, "role": "ADMIN", "departmentId": 3 }`
- **Failure responses:**
  - `401 { "error": "Invalid credentials" }` — unknown email, wrong password, or missing
    email/password (generic message on all of these — no user enumeration).
  - `403 { "error": "Account is inactive" }` — credentials are correct but `active` is false.

### POST /api/auth/logout — introduced in S1 (Backend)
- **Request body:** none.
- **Response (200):** `{ "message": "Logged out" }`, and clears the `ewt_token` cookie.
  Stateless JWT, so this is a no-op server-side (no denylist yet).

### Route guard middleware — introduced in S1 (Backend)
- `authenticate.js` reads the `ewt_token` httpOnly cookie (or `Authorization: Bearer`), verifies
  it, sets `req.user = { userId, role, departmentId }`. Responds `401` if missing/invalid/expired.
- `requireRole(allowedRoles: string[])` runs after `authenticate`; responds `403` if
  `req.user.role` isn't in `allowedRoles`. Future routes should wrap with both.

### Frontend BFF proxy routes — introduced in S1 (Frontend)
The browser only ever talks to the Next.js origin; these routes proxy to the backend so the
backend's `Secure`/`SameSite=Strict` cookie and the frontend's origin are never cross-site.
- `POST /api/auth/login` forwards `{ email, password }` to the backend unchanged, relays the
  backend's `Set-Cookie: ewt_token` header verbatim, and additionally sets its own httpOnly
  `ewt_session` cookie (`{ userId, role, departmentId }`, 8h maxAge). **`ewt_session` is a
  non-authoritative display convenience only** — it is unsigned JSON and never gates access;
  `RoleGuard`/`getSession()` authorize exclusively by verifying the signed `ewt_token` JWT
  (shared `JWT_SECRET`, HS256). Passes through the backend's status code/body as-is (200/401/403).
- `POST /api/auth/logout` forwards the request cookie header to the backend, relays any
  `Set-Cookie` it returns, and unconditionally clears both `ewt_session` and `ewt_token` on the
  frontend origin — even if the backend call itself fails/times out, so the browser is never
  left half-signed-out.

## 4. Data Models (cumulative)

### `users` table — introduced in S1 (Backend), Prisma model `User`
| Field           | Type                              | Notes                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | `Int` (PK, autoincrement)          |                                          |
| `email`         | `String`, unique                   |                                          |
| `password`      | `String`                           | bcrypt hash, cost factor 10; never plaintext |
| `role`          | `Role` enum (`ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`) |                                |
| `departmentId`  | `Int?` (column `department_id`)    | nullable; no FK table yet                |
| `active`        | `Boolean`, default `true`          | checked on every login attempt           |
| `createdAt`     | `DateTime`, default now            | column `created_at`                      |
| `updatedAt`     | `DateTime`, auto-updated           | column `updated_at`                      |

## 5. Change Log (per story, per layer)

### Story S1
**Backend (iteration 1):** Initialized the Node.js/Express backend under `backend/` with
Prisma + PostgreSQL. Added the `users` table (migration `20260810000000_init`) with `id`,
`email`, `password` (bcrypt, cost 10), `role` enum, `departmentId`, `active`. Implemented
`POST /api/auth/login` (httpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Strict JWT cookie, HS256, 8h, generic 401 on
bad credentials, 403 on inactive) and `POST /api/auth/logout` (stateless no-op clearing the
cookie). Added `authenticate.js` and `requireRole.js` middleware for future protected routes.
`backend/tests/auth.test.js` + `requireRole.test.js` (9 tests, all passing) wired into
`ci_check.py`.

**Frontend (iteration 1):** Built the Next.js App Router frontend under `frontend/`. Added
`/login` (`LoginForm.jsx`, idle/loading/error states) posting to the frontend's own
`POST /api/auth/login`. Because the backend cookie is `httpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite=Strict` with
no CORS, implemented login/logout as Next.js Route Handler **BFF proxies** (see API Contract)
so the browser stays same-origin with the frontend, forwarding `ewt_token` verbatim and adding a
same-origin `ewt_session` display cookie. Added `<RoleGuard allowedRoles={[...]}>` wrapping each
of the three role-specific landing pages, redirecting to `/login` on missing/wrong-role session,
matching the `ADMIN/MANAGER/EMPLOYEE` redirect map (also applied at `/`). Added `<LogoutButton>`,
`lib/roles.js` (routing helpers) and `lib/session.js` (`getSession`/`parseSessionToken`). 14
Vitest/RTL tests, wired into `ci_check.py`.

**Fixes (iteration 2) — frontend:** (1) `ewt_session` was unsigned JSON and forgeable from a
browser console; fixed by making `getSession()`/`parseSessionToken()` verify the **signed
`ewt_token` JWT** (`jsonwebtoken`, shared `JWT_SECRET`) instead — `ewt_session` is kept for
display only and never used for access control. (2) Logout returned 502 without clearing cookies
if the backend proxy call threw; fixed by moving cookie-clearing outside the try/catch so both
cookies always clear, even when the backend is unreachable. (3) Added
`__tests__/RoleGuard.test.jsx` and extended `session.test.js`/added `authRoutes.test.js` (26
tests total) covering the forgery and half-signed-out fixes with real signed JWTs. (4) Removed
`frontend/package-lock.json` from git tracking and added it to `.gitignore`.

**Fixes (iteration 3) — frontend:** Addressed all three review findings.

1. *Missing JSX-capable CI syntax gate.* `ci_check.py`'s per-layer syntax check only ran
   `node --check` against `*.js`, silently skipping every `.jsx` file (all pages, layout, and
   the three components) — `node --check` cannot parse JSX at all. Extended `ci_check.py` to
   additionally run each `.jsx` file through `esbuild` (already present transitively via
   vite/vitest, resolved from `frontend/node_modules/.bin`), which parses and transforms JSX
   without executing it; skips gracefully with a log line if `node_modules` isn't installed.
   Verified the gate actually fails closed: temporarily broke `RoleGuard.jsx`'s syntax and
   confirmed `python ci_check.py` caught it and exited 1, then restored the file and confirmed
   it passes again.
2. *Unsubstantiated live-verification claim.* Iterations 1–2 described manually running the real
   backend against the frontend and then discarding the setup, leaving no artifact in the diff to
   back the claim. Added `frontend/__tests__/liveIntegration.test.js` (6 tests, committed): a
   plain `node:http` server implementing the documented login/logout contract byte-for-byte is
   started on a real ephemeral localhost port, and the frontend's actual route handlers
   (`app/api/auth/login/route.js`, `.../logout/route.js`) are driven against it over a real TCP
   socket with **no mocked `fetch`** — asserting the 200/401/403 bodies, a real backend-signed
   JWT relayed in `Set-Cookie` and verified for real by `parseSessionToken`, a forged unsigned
   cookie rejected by that same path, full cookie-clearing on logout, and cookie-clearing surviving
   a real connection failure (an unreachable real socket, not a simulated error). All 6 pass;
   32/32 tests pass overall (`npx vitest run`), wired into `ci_check.py`. This supersedes the
   prior iterations' narrative-only "ran the real backend app.js" claims, which are not
   reproducible from this diff and should not be relied on as evidence.
3. *`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` exceeding the 200-added-line rule.* Condensed the Architecture tree and
   Change Log entries (this file) to fit the limit without dropping any endpoint, schema, or
   fix detail.

### Story S2
**Backend (iteration 1):** Found that S1's documented backend was never actually committed (see
the API Contract callout above) — `backend/` had only `package-lock.json` tracked in git and
empty `src`/`prisma`/`tests` directories on disk, plus a `node_modules` install with no
`package.json`. Rebuilt the backend runtime from scratch on top of that pre-existing
`node_modules` (added `backend/package.json`, restored `express`/`bcrypt`/`jsonwebtoken`/
`cookie-parser`/`@prisma/client`/`prisma`/`supertest`/`dotenv` after an errant `npm install
dotenv` without a `package.json` had pruned them; `npm install` restored all 167 packages).
Added `prisma/schema.prisma` and migration `20260810120000_init_roles_departments_users_wellness`
creating `roles` (seeded `ADMIN`/`MANAGER`/`EMPLOYEE`), `departments`, `users`, and
`wellness_entries` per the technical plan, all FKs `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, `UNIQUE` on
`users.email` and `departments.name`. Implemented `authenticate.js`/`requireRole.js`
(unchanged JWT contract from S1's docs) and the seven `/api/admin/*` endpoints listed in the API
Contract, all ADMIN-only. Email/department-name uniqueness is enforced by the DB `UNIQUE`
constraint and re-checked at the API layer (Prisma `P2002` → `409`); FK violations on
`roleId`/`departmentId` → `400`; missing rows → `404`. Deactivating a department only ever
writes to `departments` — it never touches `users` — and each department response includes
`activeUserCount` so the frontend can build the required reassignment/deactivation warning.
No live Postgres was available in this environment (`psql`/Docker daemon absent), so
`backend/tests/helpers/fakePrisma.js` is an in-memory double implementing the exact subset of the
Prisma Client API the controllers call (including Prisma's real `P2002`/`P2003`/`P2025` error
shapes), and `backend/tests/helpers/testApp.js` builds the real Express app via
`createApp({ prisma })` against it — tests drive real HTTP requests through supertest with real
JWTs, no controller mocking. `adminUsers.test.js`, `adminDepartments.test.js`,
`authMiddleware.test.js` (18 tests, all passing via `node --test`), wired into `ci_check.py`
(already supported `backend/tests/*.test.js` and per-layer `node --check`, unchanged). Full
`python ci_check.py` passes (18 backend + 32 frontend tests).

**Frontend (iteration 1):** Added `/admin/users` and `/admin/departments` under `frontend/app/admin/`
(both `RoleGuard`-wrapped to ADMIN, linked from the admin dashboard), backed by `UserManagement.jsx`
and `DepartmentManagement.jsx` (`frontend/components/admin/`) plus `UserFormDialog.jsx`,
`DepartmentFormDialog.jsx`, and `DepartmentDeactivationDialog.jsx`. Added five Next.js BFF proxy
routes under `frontend/app/api/admin/` (`users`, `users/[id]`, `users/[id]/status`, `departments`,
`departments/[id]`) that forward the `ewt_token` cookie and relay the backend's status/body
unchanged, matching the S1 auth-proxy pattern, and `frontend/lib/adminApi.js` for the client-side
fetch wrappers. Consumes every endpoint in the S2 API Contract: `GET/POST /api/admin/users`,
`PUT /api/admin/users/:id`, `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/status`, `GET/POST /api/admin/departments`,
`PUT /api/admin/departments/:id`. Each screen has loading (`role="status"`), error (`role="alert"`
with Retry), and empty states, and both forms surface the backend's exact error message (e.g. the
409 email/name-conflict body) inline without closing the dialog. User management supports
search/department/status filtering, pagination, create, edit, and activate/deactivate. Department
management supports create, rename, and deactivate; since the backend's single
`PUT /api/admin/departments/:id` never cascades to `users`, deactivating a department with
`activeUserCount > 0` opens `DepartmentDeactivationDialog` (a `role="alert"` warning) instead of
applying immediately, offering "Manage affected users" (navigates to `/admin/users?department=:id`,
which `UserManagement` reads via `useSearchParams` to pre-filter) or "Deactivate anyway".

*Contract gap:* the API Contract has no `GET /api/admin/roles` endpoint — only `roleId` (an opaque
FK) on each user record. `UserManagement`'s role picker is populated from the distinct
`{roleId, role}` pairs observed in live `GET /api/admin/users` responses, so a role with zero
existing members won't appear as a create/edit option until at least one user of that role exists.
This is a real functional gap (not just a UI nicety) for a fresh install with no users yet; a future
story should add `GET /api/admin/roles`.

*Verified end-to-end* (`frontend/__tests__/adminLiveIntegration.test.js`, 8 tests): the real backend
Express app (`backend/src/app.js` via `createApp`, imported directly — no reimplementation) is
started on a real ephemeral localhost port per test, wired to `backend/tests/helpers/fakePrisma.js`
(no live Postgres in this environment, same constraint the backend layer hit). The frontend's actual
`/api/admin/*` route handlers are driven against it over a real TCP socket with a real signed
`ewt_token` cookie — no mocked `fetch`, no stand-in server — exercising: listing seeded users with
role/department names resolved and `passwordHash` never present; a real 401 from `authenticate` on a
missing cookie; creating a user and a real 409 on duplicate email; editing a user; deactivating then
reactivating a user via the status endpoint; listing departments with a real, live `activeUserCount`;
creating a department and a real 409 on duplicate name; and — the acceptance criterion this story
depends on most — deactivating a department and confirming its `activeUserCount` and its users'
`isActive`/`departmentId` are unchanged afterward, proving the "no cascade" contract the warning
dialog relies on. No contract mismatches were found; live backend behavior matched the documented
API Contract exactly. Additionally added `adminApi.test.js` (11 tests, pure fetch-wrapper unit
tests), `adminRoutes.test.js` (9 tests, BFF proxy relay behavior with mocked `fetch`), and
`UserManagement.test.jsx`/`DepartmentManagement.test.jsx` (6 + 8 tests, RTL, covering loading/error/
empty states, create/edit/status-toggle, and the deactivation-warning flow including "Manage
affected users" and "Deactivate anyway"). `npx vitest run`: 74/74 frontend tests pass; `python
ci_check.py`: 18 backend + 74 frontend tests, all green.

> **Note on this entry:** at the start of this iteration the working tree already contained this
> exact Change Log paragraph, uncommitted, plus a small dashboard link edit — but none of the
> screens, components, BFF routes, `lib/adminApi.js`, or tests it describes existed on disk
> (`frontend/components/admin`, `frontend/app/admin/users`, `frontend/app/api/admin/*` were all
> empty). The description above was accurate to the intended design, so this iteration implemented
> it for real against that description and corrected the test counts (originally overstated as
> 7/9/76; actual is 6/8/74) to match what's actually in the diff.
